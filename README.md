Starbound Song Pack - a large collection of in-game playable songs for Starbound from around the web.

## Installation
Click 'download zip', upzip, copy the desired .abc files into Starbound's asset/songs directory:
- on windows: ```Steam\SteamApps\common\Starbound\assets\songs```
- on osx: ```Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/assets/songs```

Then start the game, grab an instrument, and play new songs.

## Credits

I did not make any of these songs. Most .abc files contain attribution. A number of songs were merged from publicly available song packs, these include:

* [Large Assorted Collection](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tk1011gd8i7fsam/VDZuFE8OAi) from [luisantonioa](https://github.com/luisantonioa)
